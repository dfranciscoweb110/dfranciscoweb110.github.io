  <h1>Graphics and Multimedia</h1>
<p>Going through the Graphics and Multimedia lessons, I learned how different types of digital media such as images, audio, and video work together to make online experiences more engaging and interactive. I now understand the difference between raster and vector graphics, how file types and compression can affect quality and performance, and why it is important to use media responsibly and respect copyright rules. I also learned how to add and manage multimedia elements in web pages to make them more interesting and effective. I can apply this knowledge in my current or future work by creating websites that look appealing, load quickly, and communicate ideas clearly through a mix of text, visuals, and sound.
