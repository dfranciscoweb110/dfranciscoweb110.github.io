  <h1>IT Careers</h1>
<p>My goal is to apply my knowledge and experience in graphic design to web development by creating an online portfolio that showcases my work on a website I design and build myself, using the skills Iâ€™ve gained from my classes. Upon completing my degree, I plan to transition into the web development field.</p>
