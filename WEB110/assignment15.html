  <h1>IT Careers</h1>
<p>My goal is to apply my knowledge and experience in graphic design to web development by creating an online portfolio that showcases my work on a website I design and build myself, using the skills I’ve gained from my classes. Upon completing my degree, I plan to transition into the web development field.</p>

<p>Through completing the activities in the “IT Careers” lesson from Wikiversity, I gained a deeper appreciation of the wide range of roles in information technology, from web designer and developer to security analyst and database administrator, and the importance of actively managing a career by aligning my skills and goals with the needs of the industry. By learning how job outlooks, certifications, and networking influence career paths, I now understand that my current focus on graphic design and web development provides a strong foundation for moving into the web development field. I plan to apply these insights by building a professional portfolio, developing my personal brand through an updated résumé and LinkedIn profile, and staying informed about new roles and technologies so I can confidently grow in the IT field.</p>
