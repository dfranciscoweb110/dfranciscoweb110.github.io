  <h1>HTML</h1>
<p>By working through these activities, I learned how to use Visual Studio Code with Git and GitHub to create and organize my web projects. Setting up and editing my HTML pages gave me practice with proper page structure, while testing and validating the code showed me how important it is to keep things clean and working correctly. This helped me see how small steps, like checking links or using the right tags, make a big difference. Moving forward, I can use these skills in class and beyond to keep my projects organized and to build websites that are both functional and reliable.</p>
