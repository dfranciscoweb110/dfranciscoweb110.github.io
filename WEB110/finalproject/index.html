<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
<img src="css.jpeg" alt="css">
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was created to separate the structure of a webpage from its presentation. Before CSS, HTML alone controlled both content and design, which made websites harder to maintain and limited visual styling options. CSS allows designers and developers to control colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing independently of HTML, making webpages more flexible, consistent, and easier to update. By using CSS, websites can be visually appealing, responsive, and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.</p>
<h2>CSS Rule</h2>
    <p> A CSS rule is the basic building block of a stylesheet. It tells the browser which elements to style and what styles to apply.</p>
<h3>Structure of a CSS Rule</h3>
    <p>A rule has two main parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Selector — chooses the HTML element(s) to style</li>
            <li>Declaration block — contains one or more property: value; declarations</li>
        </ol>
