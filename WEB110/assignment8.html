  <h1>Security</h1>
    Through the <b>GCFLearnFree Internet Safety tutorial</b>, I learned how important it is to stay cautious with personal information and be aware of threats such as phishing and malware. Simple steps, such as creating strong passwords, checking for secure websites, and thinking carefully before clicking links, can make a big difference in staying safe online. I can already apply this by being more mindful when I browse, and I see the value of reminding coworkers and family about these same practices. Building safer habits now will protect both personal and professional information in the future.
<br>
<br>
From the <b>TutorialsPoint Internet Security lesson</b>, I gained a deeper understanding of the technical side of protecting devices and networks. Concepts like firewalls, encryption, and antivirus tools showed me that security works best as a layered system. It is not just about having the right tools, but also about using them properly and staying aware of risks. I have started enabling stronger protections on my own devices, such as firewalls and virtual private networks, and I can see how these steps would be just as important in any workplace setting.

<br>
The <b>GCFLearnFree Email Basics tutorial</b> helped me realize how critical email management is for both security and professionalism. Learning to organize with filters and folders, identify spam, and avoid risky links makes email a more effective tool instead of a vulnerability. I can apply these skills right away by keeping my inbox more organized and protecting myself from scams, which will also prepare me for future professional communication.

<br>
When I <b>tested my firewall using Gibson Research ShieldsUP</b>, I saw how exposed ports could invite unwanted access. I learned that stealthed ports make a system harder to detect, which adds another layer of security. This encouraged me to be more proactive about checking my devices and router settings so that I am not leaving openings for attackers.
<br>
<br>
Finally, <b>researching password managers and multi factor authentication</b> showed me how essential they are for protecting accounts. Using unique passwords stored securely in a manager along with multi factor authentication for key accounts greatly reduces the risk of breaches. I plan to set these up across my personal and financial accounts now, and I know these habits will carry over into any future professional role.
