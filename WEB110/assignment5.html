The activity I completed was a <b>review of Smart Insightsâ€™ Honeycomb model</b> applied to major social media platforms. The topic I described was how the honeycomb framework elements, including identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups, are supported differently across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube. I learned that while some platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn strongly support all elements of the framework, others such as Pinterest, Snapchat, and Tumblr focus more narrowly on specific elements, creating strengths in some areas but gaps in others. I can apply this concept in the future by using the honeycomb model to carefully evaluate which social media platforms best align with communication, branding, or engagement goals, ensuring I choose the right channels to maximize effectiveness in a professional or organizational context.
