  <h1>Social Media</h1>
    <p>
The activity I completed was the <b>TutorialsPoint lesson on Social Networking</b>. The topic I focused on was the different types of social media sites, their features, and how people use them. I learned how each platform serves different purposes, such as connecting with friends, sharing content, building professional networks, or exploring interests. The sites that interest me most are LinkedIn, for professional growth and networking, and YouTube, for learning and creative content. I can apply this knowledge by being intentional about which platforms I spend time on, making sure they align with both my personal and professional goals.

Building on that understanding, the activity I completed next was reviewing <b>GCFLearnFree lessons on Blog Basics and Facebook</b>, along with researching free blogging platforms. The topic I focused on was understanding how blogging works, exploring options for creating a blog, and learning how to set up a Facebook account. I learned that blogs are a great way to share ideas, experiences, or expertise with a wide audience, while Facebook helps connect with people, join groups, and share updates in a more social setting. The platforms that interest me most are blogging sites for creative expression and Facebook for networking and staying connected. I can apply this knowledge by starting my own blog to share content and using Facebook to build connections and engage with communities that support my personal or professional goals.

Finally, I completed a review of <b>Smart Insightsâ€™ Honeycomb model</b> applied to major social media platforms. The topic I described was how the honeycomb framework elements, including identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups, are supported differently across Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, and YouTube. I learned that while some platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn strongly support all elements of the framework, others such as Pinterest, Snapchat, and Tumblr focus more narrowly on specific elements, creating strengths in some areas but gaps in others. I can apply this concept in the future by using the honeycomb model to carefully evaluate which social media platforms best align with communication, branding, or engagement goals, ensuring I choose the right channels to maximize effectiveness in a professional or organizational context.
