  <h1>CSS</h1>
<p>While doing these activities, I learned how to use inline, internal, and external CSS to make a web page look the way I want. Inline CSS helped me see how to quickly change the style of just one element, but internal CSS made it easier to keep things organized inside a single page. External CSS was the most useful because it lets me separate style from content and reuse the same design across different pages. I also used the W3C Validators to check my HTML and CSS, which showed me how important it is to keep code clean and error-free. I can definitely use these skills in the future to make websites that not only look good but are also easier to update and maintain.
