  <h1>Assignment 6</h1>The first activity I completed was the <b>TutorialsPoint: Internet Services tutorial</b>, which introduced me to the many different types of internet services and their purposes. I learned that internet services include tools such as email, file transfer, cloud storage, and online communication platforms, all of which are designed to help users share information and stay connected. What stood out to me the most was how interconnected these services are and how they collectively form the backbone of modern online interactions. Without these services, communication, collaboration, and the basic exchange of information would be very limited. I can apply this concept in my current environment by using email and cloud storage more effectively for schoolwork and group projects. In the future, I will be able to use this knowledge in professional settings where reliable internet services are critical for communication, project management, and data security.

The next activity I completed was reviewing <b>ExaVault: How to Access an FTP Server from the Browser and Hostinger: What is FTP</b>, followed by practicing file transfers on the demo FTP server at dlptest.com. This activity focused on <b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b> and its important role in moving files between a client and a server. I learned that FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files remotely either through a browser or an FTP client. Another important takeaway was the use of authentication through usernames and passwords, which ensures that only authorized individuals can access files. This knowledge is very practical and can be applied immediately. In my current environment, I can use FTP for sharing files or practicing website management. In the future, I will be able to apply this skill to professional tasks such as managing web servers, updating online content, and ensuring that files are transferred securely.

The final activity I completed was reviewing <b>RIAA: About Piracy and researching legal issues with peer to peer file sharing</b>, which shifted my focus to intellectual property and the consequences of piracy. I learned that downloading or sharing copyrighted materials such as music, movies, or software without permission is a violation of copyright law. This can result in severe civil and criminal penalties including lawsuits, fines, or even jail time. Beyond the legal risks, I also gained a better understanding of how piracy harms artists, producers, and the entertainment industry by reducing revenue and discouraging creativity. Applying this knowledge now means being intentional about accessing content only through legal platforms such as streaming services. In the future, I will use this awareness to respect intellectual property rights both professionally and personally, ensuring that I follow ethical and responsible digital practices.

<br>
These activities together helped me see how internet services, file management tools, and intellectual property laws are all connected in shaping the way we interact online. Each concept is not only useful for my current learning but also prepares me for the professional responsibilities I will face in a technology driven environment.
