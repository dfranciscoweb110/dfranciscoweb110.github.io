    <h1>SQL Statements Activity</h1>

<p>The following are single-table SELECT statements used in this activity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;</li>
    <li>SELECT CustomerName, City FROM CUSTOMERS;</li>
    <li>SELECT CustomerID, Country FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Country = 'USA';</li>
    <li>SELECT City FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY City;</li>
</ul>

<p>The following are the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements used in this activity:</p>
<ul>
    <li>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (CustomerName, City, Country) VALUES ('John Doe', 'New York', 'USA');</li>
    <li>UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET City = 'Los Angeles' WHERE CustomerName = 'John Doe';</li>
    <li>DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE CustomerName = 'John Doe';</li>
</ul>

<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>While completing these activities, I learned how to write and use SQL statements to manage and manipulate data within a database. I now understand how to retrieve specific information using SELECT statements and how to modify data with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. This knowledge will help me in future work or projects by allowing me to organize, maintain, and analyze data effectively in any environment that relies on databases.</p>
