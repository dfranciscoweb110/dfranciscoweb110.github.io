  <h1>Web Browsers</h1>
Activity 1: Using a Web Browser
In this activity, I explored how to use a web browser effectively, including navigating websites, opening and closing tabs, creating bookmarks, and working with the address bar. I learned how URLs function like an address that tells the browser where to go, and I realized how helpful tabbed browsing is when managing multiple sites at once. Bookmarks also stood out as a powerful tool to keep frequently used websites easy to access. I can see myself applying this in my current environment by organizing research across tabs and creating bookmarks for the tools I use daily, which will help me stay more efficient and avoid wasting time trying to find the same sites repeatedly.

Activity 2: Comparing Different Browsers
Another activity I completed involved installing and comparing different web browsers. I tried out Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera, and I quickly noticed how each browser offers unique strengths. For example, some are faster while others focus more on privacy or customization. This taught me that there is not just one best browser, because it depends on the situation and the needs of the user. In the future, I can apply this by selecting the browser that best fits what I am working on. If I want better integration with tools at work, I might choose Chrome or Edge, but if I need more privacy, I would lean toward Firefox. Having that flexibility makes me feel more prepared to adapt to different environments.

Activity 3: Configuring Extensions and Add Ons
The third activity focused on learning how to add and manage browser extensions. I discovered how helpful these tools can be, such as using a password manager, an ad blocker, or even a grammar checker. At the same time, I also learned that having too many extensions can slow down performance or create privacy risks. From this, I realized the importance of choosing only the extensions that I really need and checking them regularly to make sure they are safe and up to date. I plan to apply this by keeping my browser organized and secure, using only extensions that improve my productivity and avoiding unnecessary clutter.
