  <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
    <b>Activity 1: GCFLearnFree and TutorialsPoint</b>
The GCFLearnFree “Search Better” tutorial and TutorialsPoint “Search Engines” resource helped me improve my searching skills while also giving me a better understanding of how search engines work. I learned that using quotation marks, Boolean operators, and the right keywords can make searches faster and more accurate. I also discovered that search engines rely on web crawlers and ranking algorithms and that advertising and SEO play a significant role in determining the order of the results I see first. This made me realize the importance of being strategic with searches and also critical of how results are presented.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 2: Comparing Search Engines</b>
When I compared Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask by searching for “web search engine,” it was clear that Google provided the cleanest layout and most useful results. I also found out that Google holds the largest market share, which made sense after seeing how much better the results were compared to the others. This activity demonstrated to me that the choice of a search engine can significantly affect the quality of information I receive.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 3: Using Search Engines</b>
I also practiced using advanced search operators like exact phrase searching and site-specific searches. When I searched “search engine” and “market share” with quotation marks, the results were more precise and trustworthy than when I searched without them. I also noticed that Google’s site, wikiversity.org, search gave me better results than Wikiversity’s own search tool, which felt cluttered. This taught me how much time and effort can be saved by knowing a few advanced techniques.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 4: Evaluating Search Results</b>
Using Georgetown’s guidelines for evaluating online information, I reviewed search results and found that sources like Search Engine Land, Wikipedia, and digital.gov were the most reliable. This activity reminded me that finding information is only half the battle. The real skill is knowing whether that information can be trusted. Being able to spot credible sources will help me in school, work, and daily life.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 5: Exploring AI and ChatGPT</b>
Exploring ChatGPT was a fascinating experience. I asked when it was invented, and it explained the timeline of GPT models from 2018 to today. It felt surreal to interact with a tool this advanced, and it made me appreciate how quickly technology is evolving. I learned that AI can be a great tool for efficiency and creativity, but it is still important to double-check the information it gives.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 6: Using the Internet Archive</b>
The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine was another activity I enjoyed. It was fascinating to look at old versions of websites and see how much the internet has changed. I even added its Chrome extension because I know it will be useful in the future. This reminded me that while AI shows the future of technology, archiving tools preserve the past.
<br>
<br>
<b>Activity 7: Citing Sources</b>
Finally, I used Wikiversity’s Special CiteThisPage feature to generate citations. I noticed that while the styles looked different, they all included the same essential information. This reinforced the importance of giving proper credit when using information, whether in academic or professional settings.
