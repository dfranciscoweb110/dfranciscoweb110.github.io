  <h1>Assignment 7</h1>
    I completed the <b>TutorialsPoint activities on Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and the Domain Name System (DNS)</b>. The main topic I explored was the structure and functioning of the internet and its key components. These activities helped me gain a clearer understanding of how communication across the internet is organized and maintained. I learned that the OSI and TCP/IP models both provide a layered approach to networking, which makes it easier to troubleshoot issues and understand the flow of data. I also explored how different protocols, including TCP, IP, HTTP, and FTP, work together to ensure that information is transmitted accurately and efficiently. In addition, I discovered how the Domain Name System plays a vital role in translating human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, which makes browsing and online communication seamless for users. I can see myself applying this knowledge by improving my ability to analyze network behavior, address connectivity problems, and design secure and efficient web-based systems in both academic and professional environments.

Building on this foundation, <b>I researched and compared the license and support costs for Windows, macOS, and Linux</b>. This activity allowed me to look at operating systems not just from a technical perspective, but also from a financial and strategic one. I learned that Windows requires a paid license, usually costing between $139 and $199, with additional expenses often incurred for enterprise-level support. In contrast, macOS is provided at no extra cost with Apple hardware, but users who want extended coverage and technical support can purchase AppleCare plans. Linux stands out because many community distributions are free to use, yet enterprise options such as Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu Pro rely on paid subscriptions for professional support and security updates. This comparison showed me that choosing an operating system is not just about functionality but also about long-term budgeting and support needs. I can apply this knowledge when planning IT expenses, selecting the right platforms for projects, or advising teams and organizations on how to balance cost with performance.

Finally, <b>I researched the components required to set up a home network</b>. I learned that a basic setup requires an internet service provider connection, a modem to translate the signal, and a router to manage traffic and enable both wired and wireless connections. To enhance performance, Ethernet cables provide stable wired links, while switches expand the number of devices that can connect. Wireless access points or mesh systems can also improve coverage across larger spaces. This knowledge will help me design and maintain a reliable, secure home network that supports multiple devices and adapts as my needs evolve.
